# PDF_READER
It is an pdf reader which seperates the text and tables from the pdf. The tables stored in the final_excel.xls file. The text is stored in the pdf_text.txt file. Also all the tables are combined properly to be stored in all_together.csv for the entire pdf. The code is working quite good for the given pdf.
