13. ABSTRACT
This report summarizes the results of a study that assessed and compared six industry and government safety standards relevant to
the safety and reliability of automotive electronic control systems. These standards include ISO 26262 (Road Vehicles - Functional
"Safety), MIL-STD-882E (Department of Defense Standard Practice, System Safety), DO-178C (Software Considerations in"
"Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification), Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, AUTOSAR (Automotive Open System"
"Architecture), and MISRA C (Guidelines for the Use of the C Language in Critical Systems). The assessment was carried out along"
"the following 11 dimensions: (1) type of standard, (2) definition of safety and hazard, (3) identification of safety requirements, (4)"
"hazard and safety analysis methods, (5) management of safety requirements, (6) risk assessment approach, (7) design for safety"
"approach, (8) software safety, (9) system lifecycle consideration, (10) human factors consideration, and (11) approach for review,"
"audit, and certification. The observed strengths and limitations of the standards studied in this report could support the future"
development of a robust functional safety approach for automotive electronic control systems.
